description: Start Content Driven Development process for creating or modifying blocks
---

You are starting the Content Driven Development (CDD) process.

**Invoke the content-driven-development skill** to begin.

This skill will guide you through:
1. Content Discovery and Modeling
2. Implementation (using building-blocks skill)
3. Testing and Validation (using testing-blocks skill)

**Key Principles**:
- Test content must exist BEFORE coding begins
- Content models should be author-friendly
- Real content reveals edge cases code-first approaches miss

Ask the user: "Are you creating a new block or modifying an existing one?"

Then invoke the content-driven-development skill to proceed.
